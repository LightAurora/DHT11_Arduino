# Temperature and Humidity Monitoring with Arduino

## Overview
This Arduino project measures temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor and displays the readings on an SSD1306 OLED display.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
- SSD1306 OLED display
- Jumper wires

## Dependencies
- Adafruit SSD1306 library
- DHT sensor library

## Installation
1. Connect the DHT11 sensor and SSD1306 display to your Arduino board.
2. Install the Adafruit SSD1306 and DHT sensor libraries in your Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the provided sketch (`DHT_11_Trial`) to your Arduino board.

## Usage
1. After uploading the sketch, open the serial monitor to view temperature and humidity readings.
2. The readings will also be displayed on the SSD1306 OLED display.
